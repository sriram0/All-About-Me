        <h2><em>Education</em></h2>
        <p>
            I traveled to Australia from India when I was 5 and joined Glen Huntly Primary School in <br>Melbourne. At home my intrest for science began with my TV as Astronamy and I soon <br>
            got basic multiplycation down. By 1st grade, I had almost mastered negitive numbers, <br>fractions, and decimals. Science progressed towards the immune system for some time before <br>heading to chemistry and the periodic table, which I got soon after. Then, Khan Academy <br>boosted science and began coding as well as gave deeper insights into mathamatics. Coding <br>was continued by W3 schools and Whitehat Jr/BYJU's Future School. Then Brilliant came and<br> boosted my knowledge even more.
